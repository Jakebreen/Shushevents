An online fitness class booking, ticketing and event management application.

This project has been developed as part of a computer science degree final year dissertation. The project brings together the many skills I have gained throughout education and also through autodidactism (self-learning).

This application is in development, due to be released by May 2018. Any and all details identified within this readme may be subject to change.
